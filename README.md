### What I learned

Looking at the previous challenge, (Profile Card Component) I decided to use a outer container so I could center the card, however, upon checking the solution, I could have just used the body tag as a container to do the same. Although I managed to create the layout, I've learned that there's simpler solutions to some problems that we can obtain only by practicing. This time I was able to come up with how to do it a little bit faster then the last time, and I felt a lot more comfotable with what and how I needed to do things.
Looking at the solution, it wasn't perfect, and there was a few redundant stuff that could be written in a much simpler way, but I think that will come with experience.
In this challenge I had to create a media query, which it wasn't in the solution but I felt it was necessary to make everything fit when changing screen resolution, since things looked weird when going too small, and after a few tweeks I got it working, now I'm a little bit more confident with media query. 

### Continued development

Being able to determine when to use the body as a container and when to create a container, I'm sure there are times that it's going to be obvious, however I would like to clearly know when to or not. 
Also be able to write a easier to understando code, or at least know how I should write the classes that I'm stylizing, should I only call the class, or should I write as a path to that class? I think as the projects get more complex, it will be easier to tell which one to use, but for smaller projects it gets a little difficult to know.
